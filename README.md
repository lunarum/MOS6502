# MOS 6502 CPU emulator

An MOS 6502 emulator written in Zig. My [C version 6502 emulator](https://github.com/lunarum/VIC20-Emulator/tree/master/Emulate6502) is used as a basis to (re)write the Zig version.

Processor tests are from [Tom Harte's GitHub repo](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/ProcessorTests/tree/main/6502/v1)

Currently Zig 0.13 is used with VSCode with the Zig extension as IDE.
